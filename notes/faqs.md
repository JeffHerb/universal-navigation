## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where should the universal navigation be deployed?
> All public facing websites and web applications should implement the universal navigation. Intranets and internal applications are not currently in scope.  If you feel that there is an exception, please raise it in the Yammer group.  The Universal Navigation policy (being drafted) will also communicate the scope.

### Which Universal Navigation banner should be chosen?
> There are two options for the Universal Navigation: static and interactive. Websites may choose to implement the option that best fits the needs of each site. 

### Is this the final code, banner, and footer?
> The embed code is likely final, but until all outstanding issues have been resolved, there is always a chance of change.
>
> The design is finalized, but any major user experience or functional issues will be addressed before launch. If there are unresolved issues that would impact the user experience on a website, fall back to the simplified static version. After launch, issues and enhancement suggestions will be tracked and reviewed and the universal navigation will be iteratively improved. 

### Will the Policy be updated?
> Yes. After a launch date has been finalized. (previous policy for reference http://on.ny.gov/1uXDHuI)

### How can agency leadership or press offices get more non-techical information about the universal navigation?
> If there are non-technical more strategic questions that are not answered in the FAQs, questions can be elevated through PIO channels to the [Media Services Center](http://www.ogs.ny.gov/Core/MSC/) as the Chamber is sponsoring and guiding the effort from a user/citizen experience perspective. Please also share this demo and guidance site with any website stakeholders.

### What if a website or application cannot implement the Universal Navigation at NY.GOV launch?
> Though all applications should attempt to replace the banner at the NY.GOV launch, If that is not achievable, move forward through normal deployment schedules so that the universal navigation can be implemented as soon as possible.  All apps should have the new Universal Navigation two weeks after NY.GOV launches.

### In the Banner several links are not HTTPS which will cause a certificate error on HTTPS pages, will this be rectified?
> SSL Cert is currently in progress. All links will be HTTPS in final code.



### What if there are oustanding bugs with the interactive version of the banner?
> BETA feedback will be addressed. In the interim, fall back to the static version of the banner if issues are yet to be resolved with the interactive version or are not resolved sufficently for a site's needs. All major issues with the static navigation will be solved for launch.

### How will issues be tracked after launch?
> [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nys-its/universal-navigation/issues) in this repo will be used to track feedback, issues, and enhancement requests after the Universal Navigation is released.

### How will the Universal Navigation search field work with our local search?
> The interactive Universal Navigation's search results will first be scoped to the domain of the current site, with the user having the ability to see global results if desired. If this is satisfactory, the existing site search can be removed. If a site's search functionality is needed because of special collections or features, the static Universal Navigation can be used - which will not include a search box.



### What browsers does the Universal Navigation support?
> The interactive banner supports IE8+, Sites that support <IE8 will need to implement the static banner. More detailed browser support levels will be posted soon.

### What is the purpose of the integration of the Google Tag Manager code?
> [Google Tag Manager](http://www.google.com/tagmanager/faq.html) will enable future deployment and central management of universal analytics or other experience monitoring tools without page code changes each time. At present, Google Tag Manager is not serving any functionality. Any implementations will involve communications with the technical owners of each web property.
